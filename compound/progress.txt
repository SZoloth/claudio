## Codebase Patterns

- SwiftUI uses @Observable pattern (macOS 14+), not ObservableObject
- Settings are stored in AppSettings.swift using @AppStorage
- SettingsWriter writes to ~/.config/claudio/hook-config.sh for bash script access
- Hook script is at ~/agent-tools/brabble-claude-hook.sh
- All new Swift files must be added to project.pbxproj (PBXBuildFile, PBXFileReference, PBXGroup, PBXSourcesBuildPhase)
- MainActor dispatch required for UI updates from background threads
- Build command: ./build.sh (wraps xcodebuild)
