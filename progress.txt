## Codebase Patterns

- SwiftUI macOS menu bar app using `MenuBarExtra` with `.window` style
- `@Observable` pattern (macOS 14+) for state management in ViewModels
- File watching via `DispatchSource.makeFileSystemObjectSource`
- TOML config parsing using regex (no external dependencies)
- Session grouping with 5-minute time gap threshold for multi-turn conversations
- Xcode project structure: App/, Models/, ViewModels/, Services/, Views/
- brabble logs at ~/Library/Application Support/brabble/
- brabble config at ~/.config/brabble/config.toml

### Initial Implementation (All Stories)
- Created complete Claudio app with all 17 PRD stories passing
- Files: ClaudioApp.swift, Models/*.swift, ViewModels/*.swift, Services/*.swift, Views/*.swift

### Learnings for future iterations:
- When adding new Swift files, must manually edit project.pbxproj to include them
- PBXBuildFile, PBXFileReference, PBXGroup, and PBXSourcesBuildPhase all need entries
- ConfigParser uses regex to parse TOML since no Swift TOML library included
- ConversationSession groups turns by temporal proximity (5-min gap = new session)
- Wake word display shows all aliases: "claudio" or "claude"
